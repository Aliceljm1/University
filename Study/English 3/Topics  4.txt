I received a very precious gift from my father on my 19th birthday. It was a laptop. My father has always been very generous, but this time even I was surprised by his generosity. I could have never envisaged that he would give me such an expensive gift. At first I told refused to accept it as I believe it was an extravagant expenditure, but on his persistent persuasion I had to accept this expensive gift.

It is so difficult to describe the laptop in words, but I would just tell you something about. It was an i3 and it has a black color. I do not know the price of the laptop as it was a gift but it has been priceless for me. Whenever someone looks at the laptop the person asks me about the laptop and tells me how good it is. I am person an IT professionals so it is not stylish but also very very useful.

This gift has been very beneficial for me. It has helped me both educationally and socially. I use my laptop whenever I have to do an assignment or report. I also talk or communicate with my friends by using different websites and applications. I can say that my life would have been boring and slow if I had not had this beautiful gift. That is the reason I always tell my father how thankful I am to him for giving me such a useful thing which has actually helped me a lot.
