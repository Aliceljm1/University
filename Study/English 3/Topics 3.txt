Friends is name of the film I liked watching a lot. The film is famous throughout the world TV show about some friends. This is comedy with a lot of striking and humorous jokes.
This comedy is about some friends and their daily life about relationships between them, about relationships with their parents about problems at work and at university and things like that, but actually the point is that everything is told and seen in a very funny way and I like it a lot. …
The reason why I loved watching this film is that because the plot was really good because of .. actors and celebrities were really good and performed in a really good and positive way then and, what is more, I was able to understand their jokes and could laugh at myself together with them.
if you have time,you can try. I am sure you will like it
